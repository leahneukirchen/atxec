NAME
     atxec – run command expanding arguments from file or environment

SYNOPSIS
     atxec command ...

DESCRIPTION
     The atxec utility constructs and then executes command lines from
     specified arguments, expanding arguments like

     •   ‘@file’ with the contents of file;

     •   ‘@$VAR’ with the contents of the environment variable VAR;

     •   ‘@@str’ with the string ‘@str’ (for quoting).

     Files and environment variables are split at whitespace into multiple
     arguments.  You can use rc(1)-style quoting, i.e.  everything between
     single quotes is escaped (and regarded as a single argument), and two
     single quotes in a row expand to a quoted single quote.

     Files can contain comments, text after ‘#’ is ignored (note: the ‘#’ must
     be preceded by beginning of line or whitespace.)

EXIT STATUS
     The atxec utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     TBD
